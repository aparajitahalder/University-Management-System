# University-Management-System
This is a report based on university Management System created using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, Javascript, JSP, Servelet and Mysql.

To create a project like this you must have ecllipse installed in your pc with mysql. I have not uploaded the project files instead I uploaded the report of the project that I made. It contains all the codes that you would require. Just simply copy paste the codings from the report and save the files with the name written above the codes. You must use your own images to get the desired output. The report contains the ouput images as well so that you may track down if you have written the wrong codes.
